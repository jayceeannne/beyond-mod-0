## My top priorities
> I understand that the next 4 modules will demand most of my time. I have mentally prepared myself for the load I'm about to carry for the next six months. Managing my time wisely and sticking to my schedule will help balance my school and personal life.

#### Quality Time:
> I value spending time with my loved ones. My parents, grandma, and sisters truly are my closest friends so one thing I will squeeze in daily is eatting dinner with my family.

#### Date Night:
> One evening, on the weekend, I would like to keep open for a date night with my boyfriend.

#### Exercise:
> I know that I will not prioritize working out but to combat that I'm going to take my dogs on morning walks down the street before class. A nice added benefit would be that it will help me wake up for class.

#### Last but not least:
> If I'm unable to do any of the three tasks above throughout the week, I'll be able to look forward to church on Sunday's.
